# Dev Tools
This is a lesson on how we use Chrome Dev Tools in Jam3. Dev Tools provide a nice way of debugging your code and make things happen easier.

##How to work with Dev Tools?
To open dev tools you have to click Cmd + Alt + I (on OSX) or F12, Ctrl + Shift + I (on Windows), or if you want to open with the data of an special element just right click on it and select 'Inspect Element'

Elemets panel allow you to inspect and live edition in the HTML and CSS of a web page.
This is how this panel looks:
